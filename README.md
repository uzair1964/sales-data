# sales-data

This project is divided into three parts: data cleaning, SQL analysis, and visualization.

## Data processing
The data cleaning steps from the original notebook have been extracted into a standalone Python script located at `src/data_processing.py`.

Run the script to clean the dataset and export a processed CSV:

```bash
python src/data_processing.py
```

The original notebook `SAL_BW_Project_3 (1).ipynb` is also included with its outputs cleared for a clean reference.
